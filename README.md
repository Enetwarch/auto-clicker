# Autoclicker

This is a basic personal autoclicker I made in Java that opens in the CLI. Pressing F9 will toggle the autoclicker on or off while pressing F10 will terminate the program. Once initialized, the program can take in hotkey inputs everywhere in the screen. This is done by implementing the [jnativehook library](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/tree/2.2), specifically the global key listener and other related modules.
