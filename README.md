# Autoclicker

This is a basic autoclicker made in Java. The controls are a bit clunky due to the program relying on CLI (Command Line Interface) to detect user inputs. Future updates will implement global key listener from [jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook) to solve this issue. It will then only require the user to run the program in the CLI once, and activate or deactivate the autoclicker using the coded hotkey anywhere regardless of focused window or not.
